To write and run the Python code on the DigitalOcean Droplet, follow these steps:

Connect to your Droplet via SSH:

java
Copy code
ssh username@your-droplet-ip
Replace "username" with your Droplet's username and "your-droplet-ip" with your Droplet's IP address.

Once connected, create a new Python file for your subscriber application using a text editor:

Copy code
nano subscriber.py
This will open a new file named "subscriber.py" in the nano text editor.

Copy and paste the Python code you wrote for the subscriber application into the "subscriber.py" file.

Save and exit the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter.

Install the necessary dependencies for the subscriber application by running the following commands:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install paho-mqtt
Run the subscriber application by executing the Python file:

Copy code
python subscriber.py
This will start the subscriber application and it will begin listening for incoming messages on the specified MQTT topic.

Note: Make sure to update the code with the correct MQTT broker IP address and credentials, as well as the database connection details.
